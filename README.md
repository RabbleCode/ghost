# ghost

ghost (short for **G**reen **H**ills **o**f **S**trangle**t**horn) is a simple addon for World of Warcraft: Classic that tracks progress on the infamous Green Hills of Stranglethorn quest chain.

Usage:

- `/ghost` - Checks current character
- `/ghost name` - Checks for character named "name" on the same realm as the currently logged in character
- `/ghost name realm` - Checks for character named "name" on the realm named "realm". Supports realms with spaces in name, e.g. `/ghost Thrall Lava Lash` will search for a character named "Thrall" on the realm "Lava Lash"
